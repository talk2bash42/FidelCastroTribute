        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Timeline of Fidel Castro's life:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1926</strong> - Born in Biran, Cuba.</li>
            <li><strong>1945</strong> - Castro began studying law at the University of Havana.</li>
            <li><strong>1947</strong> - Castro joined the Party of the Cuban People.</li>
            <li><strong>1950</strong> - Castro co-founded a legal partnership that primarily catered to poor Cubans.</li>
            <li><strong>1952</strong> - Castro formed a group called "The Movement"
            which operated along a clandestine cell system, publishing underground newspaper El Acusador (The Accuser), 
            while arming and training anti-Batista recruits.</li>
            <li><strong>1953</strong> - Castro and is other revolutionaries attacked Moncada Barracks, 
            Four of the revolutionaries was killed before Castro ordered a retreat. Accompanied by 19 comrades, Castro set 
            out for Gran Piedra in the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains several kilometres to the north, where they could 
            establish a guerrilla base.Over the following days, the revolutionaries were rounded up; some were executed and others 
            – including Castro – transported to a prison north of Santiago. After a trial in which he conducted an impassioned 
            defense, he was sentenced by the government to 15 years’ imprisonment.</li>
            <li><strong>1955</strong> - He and his brother Raúl were released in a political amnesty
                and they went to Mexico to continue their campaign against the Batista regime.</li>
            <li><strong>1956</strong> - On December 2, 1956, Castro and an armed expedition of 81 men landed on the eastern coast of 
            Cuba from the yacht Granma. All of them were killed or captured except Fidel and Raúl Castro, Ernesto (“Che”) Guevara, and 
            nine others, who retreated into the Sierra Maestra to wage guerrilla warfare against the Batista forces. With the help of 
            growing numbers of revolutionary volunteers throughout the island, Fidel Castro’s forces won a string of victories over the 
            Batista government’s demoralized and poorly led armed forces. Castro’s propaganda efforts proved particularly effective, and 
            as internal political support waned and military defeats multiplied,Batista fled the country on January 1, 1959. Castro’s 
            force of 800 guerrillas had defeated the Cuban government’s 30,000-man professional army.</li>
            <li><strong>1959</strong> - Castro became premier and thus head of the government. By the time Urrutia was forced to resign in 
            July 1959, Castro had taken effective political power into his own hands.</li>

            <li><strong>1961</strong> - In April of 1961 the U.S. government secretly equipped thousands of Cuban exiles to overthrow 
            Castro’s government; their landing at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961, however, was crushed by Castro’s armed forces.</li>
            <li><strong>1976</strong> - Castro remained premier until 1976, when a new constitution created a National Assembly and 
            Castro became president of that body’s State Council.</li>
            <li><strong>1993</strong> - In late 1993 Castro’s daughter sought asylum in the United States, where she openly criticized her 
            father’s rule. The following year, economic and social unrest led to antigovernment demonstrations, the size of which had not 
            been seen in Cuba in some 35 years.</li>
            <li><strong>1998</strong> - In 1998 Castro allowed Pope John Paul II to visit Cuba for the first time.</li>
            <li><strong>2003</strong> - In 2003 the National Assembly confirmed Castro as president for another five-year term.</li>
            <li><strong>2006</strong> - On July 31, 2006, Fidel Castro passed power on a provisional basis to his brother Raúl in order to recover

            <li><strong>2008</strong> - In February 2008, just days before the National Assembly was to vote for the country’s leader, Fidel Castro 
            (who had not appeared in public for 19 months) officially declared that he would not accept another term as president.</li>
            <li><strong>2011</strong> - In 2011 Fidel stepped down as secretary-general of the Communist Party of Cuba and was succeeded by Raúl.</li>
            <li><strong>2016</strong> - In April a frail soon-to-be-90-year-old Castro told the Communist Party Congress that he would be dying soon, and 
            he implored party members to work to fulfill his communist vision for Cuba.</li>
            <li><strong>2016</strong> - Castro died on the night of 25 November 2016.[378] The cause of death was not disclosed.</li>

        ultimately to a communist society.
